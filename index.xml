Regularly update and patch all network devices and software to protect against known vulnerabilities.
•	Use multi-factor authentication (MFA): Implementing MFA adds an extra layer of security to your applications by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification such as a password, fingerprint, or one-time code.</description>
