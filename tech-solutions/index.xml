      <description>•	Implement strong network security protocols: Ensure that your network is protected by implementing strong security protocols such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and virtual private networks (VPNs). Regularly update and patch all network devices and software to protect against known vulnerabilities.
•	Use multi-factor authentication (MFA): Implementing MFA adds an extra layer of security to your applications by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification such as a password, fingerprint, or one-time code.</description>

      <description>•	Encryption: Encryption transforms data into unreadable format using cryptographic algorithms, ensuring that only authorized parties with the decryption key can access it. It safeguards the data&amp;rsquo;s confidentiality and integrity.
•	Access controls: Implementing robust access controls helps organizations manage user privileges and restrict data access to authorized individuals. This ensures that only those with the proper permissions can access and modify sensitive information.
•	Data backup and disaster recovery: Regular backup of data and creation of disaster recovery plans are essential for data protection.</description>
